Hardware Design Files
=====================

The stm8.lbr file is the Eagle library containing the symbol, package and device for the STM8L051F3 micro-controller. I created it because I could not find it anywhere (and I probably did not look hard enough anyway)

The symbol is currently untested and unverified, but I should be able to test it in a couple of weeks, and I will update this README then. If you try it before that, let me know, and I'll it update this section with that anyway
