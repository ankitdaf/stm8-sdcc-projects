Introduction
============

This repository is intended to house my experiments with the STM8 micro-controllers using SDCC as a compiler on Linux

Note : *The STM8S and STM8L micro-controllers are not pin compatible, and their registers are different too. Please use the correct links below to make sure your application code works*

Resources
=========

I used the following resources to get started : 

* [Fun and games with the STM8 on Linux](http://gctechspace.org/2014/09/fun-and-games-with-the-stm8-on-linux/)
* [Getting started with STM8 Development on Linux ](http://technologyrealm.blogspot.in/2015/07/getting-started-with-stm8-development.html)
* [How to Program STMicro STM8S $1 Board in Linux](http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/04/13/how-to-program-stm8s-1-board-in-linux/)
* [Tools for interfacing with STMicroelectronics' STM8-Discovery, STM8L-Discovery and STM32VLDiscovery ](https://github.com/afaerber/stlink)
* [Libraries for getting started with the STM8S(The links in some older blog posts are no longer valid, STM seems to have moved files around)](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257962)
* [Libraries for getting started with the STM8L(The links in some older blog posts are no longer valid, STM seems to have moved files around)](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257956)
