Introduction
============

This repository is intended to house my experiments with the STM8 micro-controllers using SDCC as a compiler on Linux

Resources
=========

I used the following resources to get started : 

* [Fun and games with the STM8 on Linux](http://gctechspace.org/2014/09/fun-and-games-with-the-stm8-on-linux/)
* [ Getting started with STM8 Development on Linux ](http://technologyrealm.blogspot.in/2015/07/getting-started-with-stm8-development.html)
* [How to Program STMicro STM8S $1 Board in Linux](http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/04/13/how-to-program-stm8s-1-board-in-linux/)
* [ Tools for interfacing with STMicroelectronics' STM8-Discovery, STM8L-Discovery and STM32VLDiscovery ](https://github.com/afaerber/stlink)
